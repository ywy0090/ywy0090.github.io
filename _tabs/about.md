# About Me

## Hello, I'm Leo Yang! üëã

I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. When I'm not training models or debugging code, you'll find me playing with cats or exploring new Steam games.

## Professional Background üöÄ

I specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), having worked on various projects including:

NLP Projects:
- Text classification systems
- Sentiment analysis and news prediction:
  - [News Popularity Analysis](https://github.com/ywy0090/news_prediction): Developed basic ml and DL models to predict article popularity and sentiment using metrics
- Language understanding models
- Conversational AI systems
- Event clustering systems
- Search ranking optimization

Computer Vision Projects:
- Semantic segmentation
- Instance segmentation
- Optical flow detection for motion tracking(https://github.com/ywy0090/TVL1_optical-flow)

Reinforcement Learning Projects:
- [Multi-agent Box Pushing](https://github.com/ywy0090/PushingBox): Explored Q-learning and team Q-learning in cooperative settings.
- [Heterogeneous Agent Box Pushing](https://github.com/ywy0090/Heterogeneous-agent-Box-pushing): Focused on coordination without information sharing.
- [Box Pushing with Circular Obstacles](https://github.com/ywy0090/Box-pushing-with-circular-obstacles): Implemented Dyna-Q and TR-Q learning in complex environments.
